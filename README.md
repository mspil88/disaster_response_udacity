# disaster_response_udacity

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to classify disaster response messages in order to empower emergency workers to better understand the help required as each message comes through. By producing categories such as 'shelter' and 'food', derived from classification algorithms, emergency workers can better cut through the noise in order to arrive more quickly at the appropriate response.
